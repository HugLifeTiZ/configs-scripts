# TiZ's Utility Scripts

Welcome to, IMO, the most interesting folder of this whole repo.

It's no stranger to anyone that desktop Linux has a whole lot of papercuts and shortcomings. A lot of them can be worked around with scripts, and here you'll find a collection of the scripts I use to work around stuff.

I have written an overwhelming majority of these scripts in POSIX sh. I've chosen POSIX sh for two main reasons: the first and simplest is that every Linux system has a /bin/sh. Second: the more limiting syntax protects me from scope creep. If there is something I should be writing as a program instead of a script, the limiting syntax *should* stop me, but often times what actually happens is that I create multiple scripts that work together to accomplish a task. That said, when I do resolve to write a Real-Ass Programâ„¢, I usually use Python 3.

Here are some great resources for writing scripts in POSIX sh:

* [Shellhaters.org](https://shellhaters.org/)
* [Pure SH Bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-sh-bible)

Here are some extra tricks that I use:

## Self-Documentation

Comments at the top of your file are all fine and good, but often times if a script hasn't been used for a hot minute, you might not remember what it does or how to use it. Wouldn't it be good if you could run your script and get that comment block? Well, you can, but the catch is you have to turn your comment block into actual code.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
usage () { script=$(basename "$0"); cat <<EOF
$script -- INSERT DESCRIPTION AND DOCUMENTATION HERE
EOF
exit "${1:-0}"; }
case "${1:-}" in -h|--help|--usage|"") usage 0 ;; esac
set -eu
```

This is MAD ugly, but it handles both documenting the script for anyone looking at the source, and also documenting its usage for anyone trying to run it. It responds to the standard flags for help and usage, and also to an invocation without arguments. You can use the usage function elsewhere in your code if someone does something wrong and you want to spit out the usage text in response, and as such it takes an argument for the exit code.

The script variable is defined only inside the usage function, because if you need to recursively invoke the script, you should do that with `"$0"`.

If the script is intended to be run without arguments, remove the `""` case. That said, this idiom is not very useful for scripts that run in the background and do things autonomously, which also typically do so without arguments.

## Self-Sudo

Speaking of recursively invoking a script, sometimes the script is intended to be invoked with sudo. Whenever that is the case, why not just go ahead and handle that ourselves?

```sh
if [ "$(id -u)" -gt 0 ]; then exec sudo -k "$0" "$@"; fi
```

First, it will only run this code if it is not already root. Second, exec takes care of ending the current invocation and also replacing the current process. Last and most importantly: unless you add an entry in the sudoers file, you will always know the script is trying to sudo because it invalidates the timestamp with -k. It's a bad idea to become root without explicit consent.

If the script runs without arguments, you can remove the `"$@"`, and it may even be safer to do so, but it shouldn't hurt anything if the script doesn't respond to arguments anyways.

If you document with a usage function, you should add a paragraph in the usage text:

```
<<! Please note that this script will invoke sudo on itself. !>>
And then make sure to explain why the script needs to sudo itself.
```
