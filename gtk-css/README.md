# GTK CSS Tweaks

If you copy or link this directory as `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/css`, you can use various customizations to tailor the appearance of GTK3 and GTK4 to your liking. Customizations vary from sheets that reduce the amount of space widgets waste, to individual tweaks of annoying elements like overshoots and client-side shadows, to customizations focused on specific apps like Xfce4-panel and Thunar.

The same codebase should be able to support both GTK3 and GTK4, but the base gtk.css file is currently gtk3.css in case there are certain tweaks that break in GTK4. Make sure you take note of that when creating links.
